Summary of the internship: 
During a 4 month internship working as a research intern at the IRIT Lab (Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse) my tasks consisted of, first, learn all about auctions ; more specifically combinatorial auctions, all the possible bidding strategies and the Game-theoretic models, only to, second and foremost, learn how to develop automatic agents willing to participate in the auction and implement said strategies to connect with the previously implemented auction server, and by doing so, we will have means to justify which strategy was better for each agent and to perform optimal actions in future participation based on either perfect or imperfect informations which would eventually help establish a game theory and have a logical game without having the notion of "chance" play as a factor. And third, create a web
server that would improve and simplify the process of holding and organizing these competitions.
